# Ghost Race - Game Server
This is a server made in Go language that will be used of my new project, Ghost Racer.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have all tools needed from prerequisites, then you can start running this server.

### Prerequisites
In order to run this server, you need:
1) Go language compiler (at least v1.12.6).
2) [Goland IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) by Jetbrains (or you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installing
1) Clone this repo.
2) Open the directory, and run this from terminal: `go run cmd/server/main.go`

## Running The Tests
For you who use Jetbrains Goland, you can simply run tests from file that has `_test.go` suffix.

## Deployment
I haven't tried to deploy this, so I'm open to suggestions.
